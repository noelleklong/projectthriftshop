          >We believe a store can be more than a place to shop. It can be a safe
          haven, a hub of opportunity, and a space where families, seniors,
          youth, and even pets find the support they need to thrive. Our mission
          is to create affordable access to essentials while building programs
          that uplift people and protect the animals we love. From clothing,
          furniture, and household goods at low cost, to food support, job
          training, senior care, mental wellness, and free pet microchipping,
          every initiative is designed to restore dignity and build stronger
          communities. And of course — we want you to come shop with us! Every
          purchase keeps our doors open, helps us pay the bills (yes, even that
          $3,000 rent ), and allows us to keep building this legacy of love and
          service. When you shop here, you’re not just finding treasures —
          you’re fueling transformation.<br /></span
        ><span class="about-us">About Us</span
        ><span class="project-loose-change"
          >For over 22 years, Project Loose Change Inc. has served children,
          seniors, families, veterans, and individuals in crisis through toy
          drives, school supply giveaways, food distributions, and emergency
          relief. <br />
          <br />Our partner, Project Thrift Shop ECT, takes those efforts
          further by creating a sustainable cycle of giving. The shop funds
          outreach programs, hosts events like Miracle Mondays and Crazy
          Wednesdays, and now provides resources like free pet microchipping —
          because people and animals both deserve care and protection. <br />
          <br />Together, we are more than a business. We are a community hub, a
          faith-driven mission, and a family of helpers — and with your support,
          we’ll keep growing and giving for years to come.</span
